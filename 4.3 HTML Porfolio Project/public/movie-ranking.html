<h1>The Best Movies According to Ozgur</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of the year</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Spider Man Into the Spider Verse</h3>
<p>This film is a sequal version and they have managed to pull out a better version than the first film which is really rare. They have a really strong plot twist</p>

<h3>Avatar-The Way of Water</h3>
<p>
    It has been very long since the first movie and they have spend both time and money on this movie. But it appears they created something unique visually even though it is all green screan
</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious 10</h3>
<p>Its classic now, fun to watch. But weak scripting</p>
